TO WIRE UP:
You need five male-female cables.
Be sure that 3 of the cables are hooked up to the LED strip (pwr=yellow, gnd=white, signal=green)
On the Arduino Nano:
Pin A4 is SDA
Pin A5 is SCL
Pin D12 is the signal
Hook up power for the lights on a 5v pin
Hook up ground for the lights on a gnd pin
On the Xavier:
Hook up the SDA cable to pin 27
Hook up the SCL cable to pin 28


The python scripts led_master.py and led_pub.py run the led strips mounted on the front
and back of the rover.

To operate the lights make sure that you have roscore running. Then run led_master.py
and led_pub.py in whichever order. The tab where you have led_pub running will ask
you to enter the rover mode and then the rover frequency ; both of these prompts
expect integers.

Here is a key to change the lights to a particular color:
Red:
mode = 0
frequency = 0

Green:
mode = 1
frequency = 1

Blue:
mode = 2
frequency = 2

Purple:
mode = 3
frequency = 3

White:
mode = 4
frequency = 4

Orange:
mode = 5
frequency = 5

Off:
mode = 6
frequency  = 6

Flashing Green (~15 seconds):
mode = 7
frequency = 7
